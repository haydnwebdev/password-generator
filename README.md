# password-generator
A password generator written in Python.

Initially, this project seemed relatively straightforward. However, there is a degree of difficulty as
the user has the ability to set the requirement for symbols and uppercase characters in password to be
true, regardless of the length of the password. For longer passwords, it is easier, but for a minimum 
length of 3 chars, this required some serious thought. This was a challenge, but one that was overcome
through research, trial, and error. The result was an implementation that I feel is efficient and
generates a secure password based on user-defined parameters.
